<h3>Research Interests</h3>

 I have a broad research interest in Probability and Stochastic Processes. During my PhD I worked under <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/~stindel/">Prof. Samy Tindel</a> on Rough Paths, SDEs and SPDEs (in particular the parabolic Anderson model). In addition I worked on modeling heat conduction in semiconductors at small length-time scales which involved working with Levy processes. My introduction to mathematical finance was under <a href="https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~kiseop/">Prof. Kiseop Lee</a> and we worked on bond pricing under partial information. This problem can be recast as a Stochastic Filtering problem and has been submitted for publication. I have also worked on strong approximations and functional limits of some stochastic dynamic systems under <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/SSL/about">Prof. Harsha Honnappa</a>.

My future plans are as follows:

1. Make contributions in the study and applications of stochastic dynamical systems which may involve a wider variety of stochastic processes and noises than Brownian motions. A relatively new approach in this regard is Rough Paths which offers a new perspective to stochastic calculus.

2. Scaling limits which arise when one studies at some macroscopic length scale the properties of some possibly interacting microscopic stochastic dynamic systems. The limiting process often tends to have nice properties exhibiting propagation of chaos, symmetry or characterization in terms of fewer parameters. 

These could be achieved by considering different models arising out of applications in engineering, science and economics.
